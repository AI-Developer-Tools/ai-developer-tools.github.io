## Course description

Students will learn how to use AI-based developer tools across the software development lifecycle, for example in coding, code reviewing, project management, automated testing, and security. The course will require significant software development practice, both with and without AI tools. Students will use their experiences to analyze the impact of AI tools on software productivity across individuals, teams, and organizations. Students will be expected to code in scripting languages (e.g., Python and JavaScript), set up development environments, read documentation, and learn new libraries and frameworks.

## Logistics and Communication

### Lectures

- Monday @ 11:00am - 12:20pm (PH A18B)
- Wednesday @ 11:00am - 12:20pm (PH A18B)

### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites. *(Although we expect experience with Python, setting up development environments, reading documentation, and learning new libraries.)*

### Readings

We will be reading a selection of online sources that will be provided. 

### Communication

The course uses [Canvas](https://canvas.cmu.edu/courses/49386) for grading, announcements, and supplementary documents. Discussion and questions will be managed on [Slack](https://aidevelopertools.slack.com/). Slides, assignments and the schedule
will be posted on this website. We use [GitHub](https://www.github.com) to coordinate group work.  We will provide private GitHub repositories for individuals and groups.

Please use Slack for discussion and questions, including clarifying assignments. If you need to write to Prof. Begel and/or Prof. Henley about the class, you must include both faculty members on the message, otherwise we will reject your message and ask you to resend to both of us. We prefer you write us on Slack instead of email.

The instructors hold weekly office hours. If you cannot make it to office hours, contact us via Slack and we will find an alternative time to meet.

If you have a question or concern unsuitable for Slack, contact both of the
instructors via email: [Andrew Begel](mailto:abegel@andrew.cmu.edu) and [Austin Henley](mailto:azhenley@cmu.edu). Unless the subject matter
is sensitive, all questions will be conveyed to all instructors before being
answered, so there's no point in emailing just one of us.</p>

For sensitive matters, of course, feel free to contact us individually.

## Grading

Evaluation will be based on the following approximate distribution: 46% in-class activities, 42% course project, and 12% homework essays.

*Note:* Attendance is required for guest lectures. Absences during guest
lectures (without previously arranged accommodations) will result in a deduction in your overall course grade.

The grading scale will be (**TODO):

- X-Y, A+
- X-Y, A
- X-Y, A-
- X-Y, B+
- X-Y, B
- X-Y, B-
- X-Y, C
- X-Y, D

## Course Policies

### Teamwork

Teamwork is an essential part of this course. Teams of 2-3 students
will be assigned by the instructors to work on the course project as well as in-class activities. Some assignments will be graded as a team, although we reserve the right to override these grades or to institute peer grading in problematic situations, as detailed in the [Team
Policy](/teamwork).

### Late Work

Due to the participatory nature of the course (in-class activities and team projects), late work is generally not accepted. However, we may allow replacing a missed activity on a case by case basis for partial credit.

### Time Management

This is a 12-unit course.  It is our intention to manage it so
that you spend close to 12 hours a week on the course, on average. In general, 4
hours/week will be spent in class, and 8 hours on assignments. A
key challenge in software engineering is that there is never enough time to
implement everything that you want to implement; it is therefore important that
you practice time management, estimation, and task prioritization.  We would
rather you make well-justified decisions to not do something than spend tens of
hours on your homework.

Note that most homework is done in groups, so please account for the overhead
and decreased time flexibility that entails.

Feel free to give the course staff feedback on how much time the course is
taking for you.  This is especially relevant as we teach this course for the
first time!

### Writing

Describing tradeoffs, justifying decisions, and communicating
effectively in a software team are key learning goals of this
course. Assignments will include discussing
issues in written form, reflecting on experiences, and presenting them to the class. The
[Student Academic Success Center](https://www.cmu.edu/student-success/programs/communication-support/index.html) offers one-on-one writing help for students, along
with workshops. The instructors are also happy to provide additional guidance if
requested.

### Use of AI

The focus of the course is to use AI for all aspects of software development. As such, it is expected that much of the artifacts you produce will come in part from AI and that the process you follow to complete assignments will also be facilitated with AI. 

However, you are still responsible for what you submit and accomplish with AI. We **do not allow AI to be used for the writing of the reflection assignments**. These are to be completed without AI assistance of any kind (based on your experience from using the AI tools).

### Academic Honesty and Collaboration

The [University
Policy on Academic Integrity](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html) applies. Most assignments are done in groups.
Our expectations regarding academic honesty and collaboration for group work are
the same as for individual work, elevated to the level of "group." Group members
will collaborate with one another, but groups should work independently from one
another, not exchanging code with other groups. Within groups, we expect that
you are honest about your contribution to the group's work. This implies not
taking credit for others' work and not covering for team members that have not
contributed to the team.

The course also includes individual assignments and individual components of
group assignments. Although your solutions for individual parts may be based on
the content produced for the group component (e.g., written reflections), we
expect you to complete individual components independently of your groupmates.

Regarding the internet, StackOverflow, and similar sources: In real-world
development, engineers often adapt code from Q&A sites, open source
repositories, or similar sources to new ends.  This is acceptable in this
course, with two caveats:

- You may not copy a solution for our homework assignments specifically from
another student or group, even if, for some reason, that code is available
openly on GitHub or elsewhere (see below on the importance of keeping your
homework code).
- You must test all of your code, and those tests must pass.  That is, you must
understand any code you adapt from the internet, and you must demonstrate that
understanding using unit tests.


Regarding solutions from other students in the course, we reuse the
[Collaboration Policy from 15-214](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~charlie/courses/15-214/2017-fall/syllabus.html), with minor modifications:

"You may not copy any part of a solution to a problem that was written by
another student, or was developed together with another student.  You may not
look at another student's solution, even if you have completed your own, nor may
you knowingly give your solution to another student or leave your solution where
another student can see it.  Here are some examples of behavior that are
inappropriate:

- Copying or retyping, or referring to, files or parts of files (such as
  source code, written text, or unit tests) from another person (whether in
  final or draft form, regardless of the permissions set on the associated
  files) while producing your own. This is true even if your version includes
  minor modifications such as style or variable name changes or minor logic
  modifications.
- Getting help that you do not fully understand, and from someone whom you do
  not acknowledge on your solution.</li>
- Writing, using, or submitting a program that attempts to alter or erase
  grading information or otherwise compromise security of course resources
- Lying to course staff.
- Giving copies of work to others, or allowing someone else to copy or refer
  to your code or written assignment to produce their own, either in draft or
  final form. This includes making your work publicly available in a way that
  other students (current or future) can access your solutions, even if others'
  access is accidental or incidental to your goals. Beware the privacy settings
  on your open source accounts!
- Coaching others step-by-step without them understanding your help.

If any of your work contains any statement that was not written by you, you
  must put it in quotes and cite the source. If you are paraphrasing an idea you
  read elsewhere, you must acknowledge the source. Using existing material
  without proper citation is plagiarism, a form of cheating. If there is any
  question about whether the material is permitted, you must get permission in
  advance. We will be using automated systems to detect software plagiarism.

It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the assignments,
  lectures, lecture notes; to give help or receive help in using the computer
  systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or other facilities; or to discuss
  ideas at a high level, without referring to or producing code.

Any violation of this policy is cheating. The minimum penalty for cheating
  (including plagiarism) will be a zero grade for the whole assignment. Cheating
  incidents will also be reported through University channels, with possible
  additional disciplinary action (see the above-linked University Policy on
  Academic Integrity).

If you have any question about how this policy applies in a particular
  situation, ask the instructors or TAs for clarification."

Note that the instructors respect honesty in these (and indeed most!)
  situations.

## Disability accomodations

If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability Resources office, I encourage you to discuss your accommodations and needs with me as early in the semester as possible. I will work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage you to contact them at [access@andrew.cmu.edu](access@andrew.cmu.edu).

## A Note on Self-Care

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. Besides the instructors, who are here to help you succeed, there are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: call 412-268-2922 and [visit their website](https://www.cmu.edu/counseling/). Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
